United Spaces is based on the idea of ​​getting ideas, people and companies to develop and grow. In central locations they provide work- and meeting areas that stands for openness, inspiration, dynamism, collaboration and sustainability. They want to be the answer to the future way of working, workplace of the future, The New World of Work. <br><br> United Spaces wanted to build a booking system for there conference rooms. Both an internal system for the receptionists and a public one for members. My mission was to design and develope a dashboard that works both for big screens as much as for tablets. The UI should also feel native when using in full screen. The first system was built with Node.js and Express.
