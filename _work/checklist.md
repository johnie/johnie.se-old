Building an accessible web for everyone. We are so focused on content issues trivial to accessibility of a project - like whether we properly use semi-colons; or the proper use of "whether." We need less grammar nuts and more accessibility nuts. The more we study and talk and write about the subject, the quicker and easier it will become to change the idea of accessibility being an afterthought or something to wait to consider until the end "if we have the time and the budget." <br><br> So <a href="https://twitter.com/roller89">Viktor</a> and I decided to build a simple checklist with collected resources about web accessibility for developers and designers to become more aware. <br><br> <a href="http://checklist.crip.se" class="btn btn--natural btn--positive btn--soft btn--old btn--contact">Visit website</a>
