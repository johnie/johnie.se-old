This was actually my first assignment at Symbio. The mission was to build a one-page WordPress theme with strong 'call to action'-strategy and using third party APIs to serve the Agenda and Speakers. Working together with <a href='http://se.linkedin.com/pub/therese-engström/0/636/89'>Therese Engström</a> was an exceptional experience. She actually gave me free hands on the design implementations. <small>Take note that the content on the site might be weird or gone.</small> <br><br> <a href='{{ link }}' class='btn btn--natural btn--positive btn--soft btn--old btn--contact'>Visit website</a>
