SIME Non-Profit has been founded to mix the 1600 business participants at SIME Stockholm  with 200 specially invited actors from the non-profit and social entrepreneurial sectors. The aim is to see how they can work together in win-win collaborations, using digital channels and technology to take on the world’s most challenging social and environmental issues. <br><br>My mission was to build a responsive one-page WordPress theme with a strong "call to action"-strategy and using third party APIs to serve the Agenda and Speakers. Working together with <a href="http://se.linkedin.com/pub/therese-engström/0/636/89">Therese Engström</a> was an exceptional experience. She actually gave me free hands on the design implementations. <small>Take note that the content on the site might be weird or gone.</small> <br><br> <a href="http://nonprofit.sime.nu" class="btn btn--natural btn--positive btn--soft btn--old btn--contact">Visit website</a>
