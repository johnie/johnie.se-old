title: Slaget om Sthlm Logo
---

I am performing a sport called Elhockey. Each year we host a tournament where all the teams around sweden play against each other. But this year we had a different main sponsor, which required a new logo. <br> <br>The idea behind the logo was to make it represent a prestigious degree in the Swedish Elhockey hierarchy. That participants in the tournament should feel honorable and inculcated.
