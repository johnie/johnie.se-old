Now in business for nearly 20 years, Nordic BioSite is recognized as a leader in supply of products for research and diagnostic, Immunology and Molecular biology, to Pharmaceutical, Biotech, Diagnostic and to academic researchers. <br><br>This was actually my first Drupal project. Even though Drupal is not really my cup of coffee, it surely was a fun and instructive process. My main mission was build the Drupal-theme from the core enabling for more project specific implementation of features. The design mockup was provided by a third party and developed by me.
