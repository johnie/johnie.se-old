The story begins about <span class="seconds-counter">1</span> ago. You clicked a mechanical button, or you tapped on a slab of glass, and you wound up here. Now that I have about 25% of your attention. You're thinking about checking Facebook again, what's new on Twitter, who is having kebab for lunch again or maybe the growing pile of work on your desk.

I am someone who aspires to positively change the world someday, I drink coffee like it’s religious holy water, and may have an unhealthy obsession with my work. But creating is not just a job for me, it’s a passion. My mission in life is to create awesome things and enjoy each moment of it.

I see myself as a hybrid designer-developer and a humble know-it-all, who likes to read about Entrepreneurship to my morning coffee, advanced SASS Design Patterns at day, and about WWII Heros at night.

I try to make the websites I design and build as simple and intuitive to use as possible whilst still having a unique aesthetic appeal. I specialise in responsive front-end design, HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I also believe in cutting edge web technologies, and care for semantics and accessibility. Which means I usually build the things I design, though I don't build things designed by others.

You have to take risks in order to move forward — I feel very passionate about that. I always say that if you feel uncomfortable, then you know you’re doing something right. Creating digital experiences that promote interaction. I think bigger, move faster, blow minds, get shit done and innovate — plus any other cliché saying that comes to mind.

I'll be happy to meet new people so don't be hesitate if you want to talk about design, music, entrepreneurship, beer or if you just want to say hello, you can always send me an email at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>
