          <p>There isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula for success. From startups just finding their feet, to established companies with decades of brand history. Each assignment is unique, and should be measured against an individual set of objectives. I see designing as walking through 'fog'. Your starting point is the start of a project. Steps should be made to discover the path. At the end of the path is your goal. The path you take depends on the choices you make and conclusions you draw. You never know what your destination is. But I definitely want to reach it every time. I want to be creative — both when working with user interfaces and code. I want to create things which have value for people and work with lasting products, may it be in Photoshop, Sublime Text, Terminal, Web Inspector, or any other tool I use on a day-to-day basis.</p>
